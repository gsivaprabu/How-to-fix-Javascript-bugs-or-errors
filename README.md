## How-to-fix-Javascript-bugs-or-errors



we will examine common bugs that are accidentally introduced when developing with JavaScript.

For each bug we will expose the problem, explain what is going on, and then exterminate the issue with a solution. 

The goal is to help prevent you from making these mistakes and in the process gain a better understanding of how JavaScript works.

Say you are testing an e-commerce checkout functionality. You observe that even after selecting ‘Debit card’ as the payment method, you are being navigated to Bank’s Net Banking login page.

### Mistake: 

There was a slipup by the developer hence the issue

### Error/Bug:

 Due to developer’s mistake, there is an error/bug residing in the code

### Defect:

 Once the bug is identified during testing, it is logged as a ‘Defect’ in the tracking system

### Fault:

 Now this is tricky. Pay attention! As an end-user of the application, the User clicks on the ‘Debit card’ option at checkout. The erroneous code has been triggered. But when will the end-user come to know of the defect? Yeah! When he sees the Net Banking login page. The duration from clicking on the ‘Debit card’ option till the User lands on the Net Banking page – there was a ‘Fault’ in the system.

### Failure:

 Literally a disappointment or a letdown. And no one wants to do business with a failure!
